                    I was born in Santa Ana, California and was raised in Pittsboro, NC. <br/>
                    I grew up with two hardworking parents to which I gained my work ethic,<br/>
                    through their sacrifices, I grew to be a curious child who often tried<br/>
                    to figure out how things work and wanted to learn more. I found myself<br/>
                    to learn better by doing things hands on, which is how I gained a passion<br/>
                    in Mathematics and Computer Science.<br/><br/>

                    From High School up to the present, I have gained multiple hobbies, some <br/>
                    that still continue to impact my life to this day. Below are my list of <br/>
                    hobbies!<br/><br/>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Cooking and Bartending</h2>
                        <p>One of my favorite series to watch as a child was an anime called<br/>
                        One Piece, one character in particular inspired me with his love of <br/>
                        cooking, so I began experimenting with food at home. Mind you, I was <br/>
                        8-10 years old so my experiments were horrendous, but over time I began<br/>
                        to start cooking traditional and healthy meals. Once I reached the age <br/>
                        of 23, I began to experiment with bartending, trying to recreate cocktails<br/>
                        and even going as far as to make some signature cocktails to call my own.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Fitness and Nutrition</h2>
                        <p>I grew up overweight, before starting college, I decided to change that <br/>
                        and started to exercise regularly and experimented with different diets, some<br/>
                        extreme, some not disciplined enough. When I started to make progress, I started<br/>
                        to grow a passion for it and started to dive into the world of BodyBuilding.<br/>
                        Bodybuilding has taught me to be more disciplined with not only my workouts<br/>
                        but also my dieting. As a result, I am working towards my first Physique <br/>
                        Competition and getting a certification in Personal Training.

                        <h2>Dancing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Coming from a Hispanic household, dancing has always been a core principle<br/>
                            in the culture. I grew up not learning how to dance out of lack of interest<br/>
                            over time, I started to grow tired of being the only one at family functions<br/>
                            who couldn't dance, so I decided to take Salsa classes to kind of dive into <br/>
                            dancing. I began taking classes with Mambo Dinamico Dance Company, and while<br/>
                            the style of Salsa was different to the style my family does, I fell in love<br/>
                            with dancing and have been going religiously for the past year. I am slowly<br/>
                            diving into other latin dance styles such as Bachata, Merengue, and Cumbia.
